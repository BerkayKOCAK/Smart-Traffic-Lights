# Smart-Traffic-Lights

Traffic congestion is main problem of modern transportation.
There is many sides of this problem such as, driver faults, insufficient road designs,  inadequate control systems etc.
Among all these problems our subject is traffic lights and their reflection on congestion.In our researches, different timings on traffic light creates discrete congestion.
With this observed difference, we can build a new structure to provide a new approach on traffic congestion.
\\
In this project we will compare predefined manual traffic lights with aligned smart traffic lights to test our proposed solution.
